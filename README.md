# YLTCPBroadcaster [![Supported Plateforms](https://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/p/YLTCPBroadcaster/badge.svg)](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/YLTCPBroadcaster/) ![Version](https://cocoapod-badges.herokuapp.com/v/YLTCPBroadcaster/badge.svg)

YLTCPBroadcaster is a small library written in Objective-C to find every host with a given TCP port number open on the network. It works like an UDP broadcast but for the TCP protocol.

## How it works

The main concept behind the `YLTCPBroadcaster` is very simple. To simulate the broadcast, the library creates a  connection to every host on the network on the specified TCP port number. Then it waits for a response and in this manner it can determine whether the host is open on the given port number.

## Usage

```objective-c
YLTCPBroadcaster *bc = [YLTCPBroadcaster defaultBroadcaster];
[bc scanWithPort:8080 timeoutInterval:1.5 completionHandler:^(NSArray *hosts) {
   // E.g.: ["192.168.0.3", "192.168.0.56", "192.168.0.87"]
   NSLog(@"Available hosts: %@", hosts);
}];
```

## Requirements

- iOS 6.0+
- Xcode 6.0

## Installation

The recommended approach to use _YLTCPBroadcaster_ in your project is using the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation.

### CocoaPods

Install CocoaPods if not already available:

``` bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```
Go to the directory of your Xcode project, and Create and Edit your Podfile and add YLTCPBroadcaster:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '6.0'
pod 'YLTCPBroadcaster', '~> 1.0.0'
```

Install into your project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

### Manually

[Download](https://github.com/YannickL/YLTCPBroadcaster/archive/master.zip) the project and copy the `YLTCPBroadcaster` folder into your project and then simply `#import "YLTCPBroadcaster.h"` in the file(s) you would like to use it in.
